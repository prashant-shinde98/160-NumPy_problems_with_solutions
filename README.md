# NumPy 160+ Problems with Solutions

Welcome to my repository of **160+ NumPy problems** with detailed solutions! ðŸŽ‰ This repo is a comprehensive guide to mastering NumPy, covering everything from the basics of creating arrays to advanced indexing, broadcasting, and more. Whether you're a beginner or looking to deepen your understanding of NumPy, this collection will help you improve your skills and solidify your concepts.

## Introduction

NumPy is a powerful library for numerical computations in Python, widely used for data science, machine learning, and scientific computing. This repository contains **160+ solved problems**, divided into various categories to help you learn NumPy step by step. The solutions are written in Python and aim to provide clarity and depth for each concept.

## Topics Covered

The problems in this repository cover the following topics:

1. **Creating NumPy Arrays**: Different ways to create 1D, 2D, and 3D arrays, using functions like `np.array()`, `np.arange()`, `np.linspace()`, `np.zeros()`, `np.ones()`, etc.
2. **Array Attributes**: Understanding array shapes, dimensions, sizes, data types (`dtype`), and more.
3. **Mathematical Operations**: Performing element-wise arithmetic operations, matrix multiplication, and other mathematical functions like `np.add()`, `np.multiply()`, `np.dot()`, etc.
4. **Statistical Functions**: Calculating mean, median, standard deviation, variance, correlation, etc.
5. **Indexing and Slicing**: Accessing elements using positive/negative indexing, slicing arrays, and working with subarrays.
6. **Iteration**: Looping through arrays using `np.nditer()` and other iteration techniques.
7. **Reshaping**: Changing the shape of arrays using `reshape()`, `ravel()`, `flatten()`, `transpose()`, etc.
8. **Advanced Indexing**: Using fancy indexing, boolean indexing, and advanced indexing techniques.
9. **Broadcasting**: Understanding how NumPy handles operations with arrays of different shapes.
10. **Creating Custom Functions**: Writing custom functions with `def` for complex array manipulations.
11. **Working with Missing Values**: Handling `NaN` values, filtering, and using `np.isnan()` and `np.nan` functions.
12. **Plotting Graphs**: Visualizing data with NumPy and Matplotlib for better understanding of data patterns.
13. **NumPy Functions**: Exploring useful functions like `np.where()`, `np.unique()`, `np.argsort()`, `np.concatenate()`, etc.
14. **Set Functions**: Using set operations such as `np.intersect1d()`, `np.union1d()`, `np.setdiff1d()`, and more.
15. **Conceptual Problems**: Problems designed to challenge and test your understanding of NumPy concepts.
